2013-02-08    mlpack 1.0.4

  * Force minimum Armadillo version to 2.4.2.

  * Better output of class types to streams; a class with a ToString() method
    implemented can be sent to a stream with operator<<.  See #164.

  * Change return type of GMM::Estimate() to double (#266).

  * Style fixes for k-means and RADICAL.

  * Handle size_t support correctly with Armadillo 3.6.2 (#267).

  * Add locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), found in src/mlpack/methods/lsh/.

  * Better tests for SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and NCA (neighborhood
    components analysis).

2012-09-16    mlpack 1.0.3

  * Remove internal sparse matrix support because Armadillo 3.4.0 now includes
    it.  When using Armadillo versions older than 3.4.0, sparse matrix support
    is not available.

  * NCA (neighborhood components analysis) now support an arbitrary optimizer
    (#254), including stochastic gradient descent (#258).

2012-08-15    mlpack 1.0.2

  * Added density estimation trees, found in src/mlpack/methods/det/.

  * Added non-negative matrix factorization, found in src/mlpack/methods/nmf/.

  * Added experimental cover tree implementation, found in
    src/mlpack/core/tree/cover_tree/ (#156).

  * Better reporting of boost::program_options errors (#231).

  * Fix for timers on Windows (#218, #217).

  * Fix for allknn and allkfn output (#210).

  * Sparse coding dictionary initialization is now a template parameter (#226).

2012-03-03    mlpack 1.0.1

  * Added kernel principal components analysis (kernel PCA), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/kernel_pca/ (#47).

  * Fix for Lovasz-Theta AugLagrangian tests (#188).

  * Fixes for allknn output (#191, #192).

  * Added range search executable (#198).

  * Adapted citations in documentation to BiBTeX; no citations in -h output
    (#201).

  * Stop use of 'const char*' and prefer 'std::string' (#183).

  * Support seeds for random numbers (#182).

2011-12-17    mlpack 1.0.0
