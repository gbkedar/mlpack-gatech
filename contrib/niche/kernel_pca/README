Compile as library:
  fl-build kernel_pca

Compile executable from library kernel_matrix_algs
  fl-build kernel_pca_main_from_lib

Compile executable from scratch (without using library)
  fl-build kernel_pca_main_standalone

If you look at the bash shell script 'do_kernel_pca', you will see an example of using fx-run to run an experiment with multiple bandwidths.

Alternatively, you can just run the program without using fx-run, for a single set of parameters:
  ./kernel_pca_main_standalone --data=data.txt --algs/h=0.5
