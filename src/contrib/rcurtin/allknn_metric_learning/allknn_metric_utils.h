 *
 * Our objective is to learn a metric to optimize the performance of
 * all-k-nearest-neighbors.  The specific thing we are seeking is the matrix A
 * in the distance calculation d(x_i, x_j) = x_i^T * A * x_j; in this method we
 * have restricted A to being diagonal.
 *
 * A user passes in the dataset which is to be analyzed with AllkNN, an output
 * file to store the weights, and optionally a file of initial weights to start
 * from (if, for instance, a better set of weights is already known).  The
 * number of iterations performed, the number of neighbors k, and the learning
 * rate alpha can all be specified.
 *
 * This code uses the old-style FASTLIB FX system (which will need to be
 * changed).
