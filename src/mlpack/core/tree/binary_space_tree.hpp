 * A binary space partitioning tree, such as a KD-tree or a ball tree.  Once the
 * bound and type of dataset is defined, the tree will construct itself.  Call
 * the constructor with the dataset to build the tree on, and the entire tree
 * will be built.
 *
 * This particular tree does not allow growth, so you cannot add or delete nodes
 * from it.  If you need to add or delete a node, the better procedure is to
 * rebuild the tree entirely.
 *
 * This tree does take one parameter, which is the leaf size to be used.  You
 * can set this at runtime with --tree/leaf_size [leaf_size].  You can also set
 * it in your program using CLI:
 *
 * @code
 * CLI::GetParam<int>("tree/leaf_size") = target_leaf_size;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param leaf_size Maximum number of points allowed in each leaf.
 *
 * @tparam BoundType The bound used for each node.  The valid types of bounds
 *     and the necessary skeleton interface for this class can be found in
 *     bounds/.
 * @tparam StatisticType Extra data contained in the node.  See statistic.hpp
 *     for the necessary skeleton interface.
