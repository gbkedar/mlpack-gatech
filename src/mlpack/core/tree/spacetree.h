/**
 * A binary space partitioning tree, such as a KD-tree or a ball tree.  Once the
 * bound and type of dataset is defined, the tree will construct itself.  Call
 * the constructor with the dataset to build the tree on, and the entire tree
 * will be built.
 *
 * This particular tree does not allow growth, so you cannot add or delete nodes
 * from it.  If you need to add or delete a node, the better procedure is to
 * rebuild the tree entirely.
 *
 * This tree does take one command line parameter, which is the leaf size to be
 * used.  You can set this at runtime with --tree/leaf_size [leaf_size].  You
 * can also set it in your program using CLI:
 *
 * @code
 *   CLI::GetParam<int>("tree/leaf_size") = target_leaf_size;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam TBound The bound used for each node.  The valid types of bounds and
 *     the necessary skeleton interface for this class can be found in bounds/.
 * @tparam TDataset The type of dataset (forced to be arma::mat for now).
 * @tparam TStatistic Extra data contained in the node.  See statistic.h for
 *     the necessary skeleton interface.
