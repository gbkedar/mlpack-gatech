/**
 * The NeighborSearch class is a template class for performing distance-based
 * neighbor searches.  It takes a query dataset and a reference dataset (or just
 * a reference dataset) and, for each point in the query dataset, finds the k
 * neighbors in the reference dataset which have the 'best' distance according
 * to a given sorting policy.  A constructor is given which takes only a
 * reference dataset, and if that constructor is used, the given reference
 * dataset is also used as the query dataset.
 *
 * The template parameters Kernel and SortPolicy define the distance function
 * used and the sort function used.  More information on those classes can be
 * found in the kernel::ExampleKernel class and the NearestNeighborSort class.
 *
 * This class has several parameters configurable by the CLI interface:
 *
 * @param neighbor_search/k Parameters for the distance-based neighbor search.
 * @param neighbor_search/single_mode If set, single-tree mode will be used
 *     (instead of dual-tree mode).
 * @param neighbor_search/naive_mode If set, naive computation will be used (no
 *     trees). This overrides the single_mode flag.
 *
 * @tparam Kernel The kernel function; see kernel::ExampleKernel.
 * @tparam SortPolicy The sort policy for distances; see NearestNeighborSort.
